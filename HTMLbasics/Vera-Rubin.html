  <p>Known best as being the discoverer, or rather the confirmer, of Dark Matter, Vera Rubin, Born Vera Cooper, was an inspiration to a generation of scientifically minded women.  She fell in love with the stars at an early age and committed to a lifetime of trying to unravel their mysteries. Vera completed her bachlor degree in Astronomy at Vasser in 1948; the only women to graduate with that major in her class. Her work at Carnege Institution in colaboration with W. Kent Ford Jr. led to the substantiation that the greater part of the universe is not visible and that Dark Matter and Dark Energy are significantly responsible for shaping the current gravitaitonal forces in the universe. She successfully carved a niche in the male dominated arena of astronomy despite facing the dismissal of her ideas by elitists, observatories that did not have facilities for women, and being forced to take meetings in lobbies because women were not allowed in offices with the men. She balanced her ground breaking career with tremendous personal success; married for 60 years to Robert Rubin and raising 4 children, all of whom went on to earn Ph.D's in natural sciences or mathematics. She demonstrated exellence in every area of her life and blazed an aspirational trail for other women in sciences to follow.

    "I live and work with three basic assumptions," Rubin once wrote:
    <ol>
      <li>There is no problem in science that can be solved by a man that cannot be solved by a woman.</li>
      <li>Worldwide, half of all brains are in women.</li>
      <li>We all need permission to do science, but, for reasons that are deeply ingrained in history, this permission is more often given to men than to women."</li>
    </ol>
